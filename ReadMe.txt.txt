Background: This program was written for my Artificial Intelligence class in the Spring semester of 2015.
It was my final project for the class. 
	This program is intended as a simple simulation of the evolutionary process for a simulated microbe
within a virtual environment. It is very rudimentary, and yet it gave startling results when it was run.
Despite only using a simple array of sixteen Boolean values as its genetic structure (ignoring the
complexities of real biological genetics), the results were exciting to witness. On multiple iterations
of running the simulation, the simple "microbes" evolved fascinating methods of survival in a virtual
environment with prey and predators. The "microbes" even took advantage of quirks in the virtual environment
and details about how it was coded.
	Eventually, cooperative behavior and specialization in colonies was observed on multiple iterations
of running the simulation. This was very surprising, given that all the "microbes" had to work with was
sixteen Boolean values in their genomes!

A copy of the report is included as a Word document. I received an excellent grade on this project, and
in the class.
